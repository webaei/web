<p>From dry winter winds to certain skin conditions, peeling hands are a common problem that can be both unsightly and uncomfortable. The good news is that there are a number of things you can do to help treat peeling hands and get them back to feeling soft and smooth.</p></p><p><h2>1. Moisturize Regularly</h2></p><p><p>One of the most important things you can do to treat peeling hands is to moisturize them regularly. This will help to keep your skin hydrated and prevent it from drying out and peeling. Look for a moisturizer that is fragrance-free and non-comedogenic, so it won't clog your pores. Apply the moisturizer to your hands several times a day, especially after washing them.</p></p><p><h2>2. Use a Mild Soap</h2></p><p><p>When you wash your hands, be sure to use a mild soap that is free of harsh chemicals and fragrances. Harsh soaps can strip your skin of its natural oils, leading to dryness and peeling. Instead, opt for a gentle soap that will cleanse your skin without irritating it.</p></p><p><h2>3. Wear Gloves When Doing Chores</h2></p><p><p>If you have to do chores that involve contact with harsh chemicals or hot water, be sure to wear gloves to protect your hands. Chemicals and hot water can both damage your skin and lead to peeling. Gloves will help to keep your hands protected and prevent them from drying out.</p></p><p><h2>4. Avoid Hot Water</h2></p><p><p>Hot water can be very drying to your skin, so it's best to avoid it whenever possible. When you wash your hands, use lukewarm water instead of hot water. You should also avoid taking hot baths or showers, as these can also dry out your skin.</p></p><p><h2>5. Treat Underlying Skin Conditions</h2></p><p><p>If you have a skin condition that is causing your hands to peel, it's important to treat the underlying condition in order to prevent the peeling from recurring. There are a number of different skin conditions that can cause peeling hands, including eczema, psoriasis, and contact dermatitis. If you're not sure what's causing your peeling hands, see a dermatologist for diagnosis and treatment.</p></p><p>The above is all the content that the editor wants to share with you.
